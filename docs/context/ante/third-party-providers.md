Adding a 3rd Party Provider
Connect Ante to third-party and custom LLM providers
Ante supports connecting to third-party LLM providers beyond the built-in catalog. Any provider that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API can be used with Ante.
​

Using Open Router
The easiest way to access third-party models is through Open Router, which provides a unified API for hundreds of models from different providers.

1

Get an Open Router API key
Sign up at openrouter.ai and generate an API key.

2

Set your API key

Copy

Ask AI
export OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..."


3

Select a model
Browse Open Router’s model list and use the model identifier:

Copy

Ask AI
ante --provider open-router --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5

​

OpenAI-compatible providers
Many LLM providers expose an OpenAI-compatible API (e.g., Together AI, Fireworks, Groq Cloud, Perplexity). You can connect to these through the OpenAI provider by setting a custom base URL.

1

Set the base URL
Point the OpenAI provider to your chosen service:

Copy

Ask AI
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.together.xyz/v1"


2

Set your API key

Copy

Ask AI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-provider-api-key"


3

Run with the OpenAI provider

Copy

Ask AI
ante --provider openai --model meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf

​

Local models
For fully offline usage with local GGUF models via the built-in llama.cpp engine, see Offline Mode.

Copy

Ask AI
ante --provider local

​

Tips

When using third-party providers, make sure the model you select supports tool use (function calling). Ante relies on tool use for its agent capabilities.

Not all models work equally well as coding agents. Models need strong instruction following and tool use support. If you experience issues, try a larger or more capable model.
