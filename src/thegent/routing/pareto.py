"""Public dict-based ParetoRouter shim.

Wraps the internal RouteCandidate-based ParetoRouter from pareto_router.py
with a simple dict API suitable for property-based testing and external callers.

Provider dict schema::

    {
        "model":       str,    # model identifier (must be unique per list)
        "cost":        float,  # cost per call (>= 0)
        "latency_ms":  int,    # expected latency in milliseconds
        "quality":     float,  # quality score in [0, 1]
