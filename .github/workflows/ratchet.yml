# Q2 Quality Ratchet Template

> **Source audit:** `FLEET-AUDIT-REPORT.md` — Q2 (Quality eng ratchets) is P1 priority (9/11 audited repos at score 0).
> **Method:** Add a CI gate that fails if the test coverage (or complexity, or lint warnings) regresses from the current baseline. The ratchet only allows improvement.
> **How to use:** Copy the workflow below to your repo as `.github/workflows/ratchet.yml`, customize the metric (coverage / lint / complexity), commit, push. Lifts Q2 from 0 to 2 (wired).

## What is Q2?

Q2 (Quality eng ratchets) = CI gates that prevent quality regressions. Common ratchets:
- **Coverage ratchet:** coverage can only go UP. If it drops, build fails.
- **Lint warning ratchet:** number of `#[allow(...)]` or `eslint-disable` lines can only go DOWN.
- **Complexity ratchet:** cyclomatic complexity per function can only go DOWN (or stay under a threshold).
- **Duplication ratchet:** code duplication percentage can only go DOWN.

**The "wired" (Q2=2) signal**: at least one ratchet is enforced in CI, with a baseline file that the build reads + asserts against.

## Template: `.github/workflows/ratchet.yml`

The example below uses a coverage ratchet (the most common). Adapt the `command:` line for your stack.

```yaml

  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

## How to apply

1. Copy the template above to your repo as `.github/workflows/ratchet.yml`.
2. Adapt the `Setup language` and `Run tests with coverage` steps for your stack.
3. Pin the SHAs:
   - `actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd`
   - `actions/setup-node@1a4442cacd436585916f4bd0495db9b8a8a0d4d8` (v4)
4. Commit + push + open a PR.

## Q2 score lift

- **0 → 1 (ad-hoc):** workflow exists but coverage baseline not committed.
- **0 → 2 (wired):** workflow exists AND coverage baseline is committed AND the ratchet fails the build on regression.
- **0 → 3 (measured):** the ratchet also tracks complexity + lint warnings + duplication (multi-metric ratchet); the baseline is updated automatically on every merge to main; the workflow reports the trend in the PR comment.

## Reference: OmniRoute

OmniRoute is the reference repo for Q2 (Q2=2). It has a coverage ratchet enforced in CI (60/60/60/60 for statements/branches/functions/lines). The template above is a minimal extraction of that pattern.

## How to validate

After applying:
1. Push a trivial change; the ratchet should pass
2. Delete a test; commit + push; the ratchet should fail
3. Add the test back; the ratchet should pass again
