## Child-Agent and Delegation Policy

- Use child agents liberally for scoped discovery, audits, multi-repo scans, and implementation planning before direct parent-agent edits.
- Prefer delegating high-context or high-churn tasks to subagents, and keep parent-agent changes focused on integration and finalization.
- Reserve parent-agent direct writes for the narrowest, final decision layer.
